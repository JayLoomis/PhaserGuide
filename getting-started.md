# Getting Started with Phaser

Phaser is a JavaScript library for making 2D games in HTML 5.

To get started, you need:

-   A copy of the library (phaser.js) which you can get
    [here](https://phaser.io/download/stable).
    -   Download the **js** file while developing, because it has comments and
        such to help.
    -   Use the **min.js** file in production, because it's been minified to
        download faster.
-   A local web server to test your work.
    -   The easiest way to get one is to use:
    
        ```bash
        sudo npm install http-server
        ```
        
        Provided you're set up to use `npm`.
    -   Any web server will do (you just need to be able to load local files
        with http).
-   A text editor or IDE.
